bump: patch

### Fixed
- Currency API fetch now works in Web Worker context (fixes the root cause of issue #18)
- The `fetch_json` function now uses `js_sys::global()` to detect and use either `Window` or `WorkerGlobalScope` context
- Previously, `web_sys::window()` returned `None` in Web Workers, causing silent API fetch failures

### Changed
- Added `WorkerGlobalScope` feature to web-sys dependency in Cargo.toml
