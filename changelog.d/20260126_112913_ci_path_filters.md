bump: patch

### Changed
- Add path filters to CI workflow (`ci.yml`) to only trigger on changes to `src/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `scripts/`, `web/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Add path filters to deploy workflow (`deploy.yml`) to only trigger on changes to `src/`, `data/`, `web/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Add path filters to release workflow (`release.yml`) to only trigger on changes to `src/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `scripts/`, `web/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- This prevents CI/CD from running unnecessarily on documentation-only changes, changelog fragments, or other non-code files (like `CLAUDE.md`)
