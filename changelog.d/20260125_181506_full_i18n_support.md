### Added
- Full i18n (internationalization) support for error messages in all 7 languages (English, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, German, French)
- Error information with translation keys (`error_info`) in `CalculationResult` for frontend localization
- Calculation step translation keys (`steps_i18n`) for future step-by-step translation support
- GitHub issue report localization - issue titles and report content are now translated to the user's selected language
- New translation sections: `errors` (16 error types), `steps` (15 step types), `issueReport` (19 labels), and `common` (3 common terms)

### Changed
- Links notation interpretation is now displayed before the result value in the UI (similar to Wolfram Alpha layout)
- Error messages in the UI are now translated using i18n keys when available, with fallback to raw error messages
- `CalculatorError` now includes `to_error_info()` method that provides translation keys and interpolation parameters
- GitHub issue URL generation now accepts an optional translation function for localized reports

### Fixed
- Error messages were previously displayed in English only - now they respect the user's language preference
