### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.
