### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection
